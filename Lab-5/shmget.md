## shmget()

### Purpose:
The shmget() function is used to create or retrieve a shared memory segment in a Unix-like system. Shared memory segments provide a mechanism for processes to share data efficiently, without the overhead of inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes or sockets.

### Arguments:

 - `key_t key`: This is a unique identifier for the shared memory segment. It can be either:
        IPC_PRIVATE: Creates a private shared memory segment that is accessible only to the creating process and its child processes.
        A non-zero integer: This integer serves as a key to identify an existing shared memory segment or to create a new one if it doesn't exist.

 - `size_t size`: Specifies the size of the shared memory segment in bytes.

 - `int shmflg`: This is a bitmask that controls the creation and permissions of the shared memory segment. The possible flags are:
        IPC_CREAT: Creates a new shared memory segment if it doesn't exist.
        IPC_EXCL: Returns an error if IPC_CREAT is set and the segment already exists.
        0600: Sets the permissions to read and write for the owner only.
        0666: Sets the permissions to read and write for the owner, group, and others.
