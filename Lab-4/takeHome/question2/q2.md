## Objective

Develop a C program that creates a hierarchical process tree to read specific lines from a file. Each process should handle its part of the task in the hierarchy, with specific string functionality applied based on the process tree structure. Each parent process must wait for all its child processes to complete before it exits. The root process should print the entire file content to terminal after all child processes complete.

## Task Description

### Process Tree Structure

1. Create a root process (`Root`) that forks two child processes (`P2` and `P3`).
2. `P2` forks two child processes (`P4` and `P5`).
3. `P3` forks two child processes (`P6` and `P7`).
4. `P4` forks one child process (`P8`).
5. `P7` forks two child processes (`P9` and `P10`).
6. Each process (`P8`, `P5`, `P6`, `P7`, `P9`, `P10`) reads a specific line from `input.txt`.

### File Reading Requirements

- `P8` reads the first line (line 0) from `input.txt`.
- `P5` reads the second line (line 1) from `input.txt`.
- `P6` reads the third line (line 2) from `input.txt`.
- `P9` reads the fourth line (line 3) from `input.txt`.
- `P10` reads the fifth line (line 4) from `input.txt`.
- `P7` reads the sixth line (line 5) from `input.txt`.

### Process Management

- Each process must wait for all its child processes to complete before it exits.

### Root Process Functionality

- After all child processes have finished, the root process prints the entire contents of `input.txt` on terminal.

### Function Implementation

- Implement a function `void read_line_from_file(const char* filename, int line_number, char* buffer)` to read a specific line from the file and handle buffer management.

### Synchronization

- Use `fork()` to create child processes.
- Use `wait()` to ensure proper synchronization and that each parent process waits for all its child processes to complete before exiting.

### Output Expectations
- Each process prints its PID and the children its creating (if applicable).
- Each process prints its PID and the read line (if applicable).
- The root process prints the entire content of `input.txt` after all child processes complete.

## Modularisation

- misc.c contains void read_line_from_file(const char* filename, int line_number, char* buffer)
- processCreation deals wiht forking and tree creation.
- Submit along with a Makefile.

## Example Output (may vary)

```plaintext
Root process: PID = 27980, creating P2 and P3
Process P2: PID = 27981, creating P4 and P5
Process P3: PID = 27982, creating P6 and P7
Process P4: PID = 27983, creating P8
Process P6: PID = 27984, read line: Third line of the file
Process P8: PID = 27985, read line: First line of the file
Process P7: PID = 27986, creating P9 and P10
Process P5: PID = 27987, read line: Second line of the file
Process P9: PID = 27988, read line: Fourth line of the file
Process P10: PID = 27989, read line: Fifth line of the file
Process P7: PID = 27986, read line: Sixth line of the file

Root process printing lines:
First line of the file
Second line of the file
Third line of the file
Fourth line of the file
Fifth line of the file
Sixth line of the file
