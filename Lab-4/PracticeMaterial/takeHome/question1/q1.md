## Objective

Develop a C program that creates a hierarchical process tree to read specific lines from a file. Each process should handle its part of the task in the hierarchy, with the root process printing the entire file content after all child processes complete.

## Task Description

### Process Tree Structure

1. Create a root process (`Root`) that forks two child processes (`P2` and `P3`).
2. `P2` forks two child processes (`P4` and `P5`).
3. `P3` forks one child process (`P6`).
4. Each leaf process (`P4`, `P5`, `P6`) reads a specific line from the file `input.txt`.

### File Reading Requirements

- `P4` reads the first line (line 0) from `input.txt`.
- `P5` reads the second line (line 1) from `input.txt`.
- `P6` reads the third line (line 2) from `input.txt`.

### Root Process Functionality

- The root process should wait for `P2` and `P3` to complete.
- After all child processes have finished, the root process prints the entire contents of `input.txt`.

## Write a C Program to Achieve the Following

1. **Implement the hierarchical process creation** as described.
2. **Ensure each process** correctly reads the specified line from `input.txt` and prints it.
3. **The root process** should print the contents of `input.txt` after all child processes have finished.

### Function Implementation

- Implement a function `void read_line_from_file(const char* filename, int line_number, char* buffer)` to read a specific line from the file and handle buffer management.

### Synchronization

- Use `fork()` to create child processes.
- Use `wait()` to ensure proper synchronization and that the root process waits for all child processes to complete.

### Output Expectations

- Each process prints its PID and the line it reads from the file.
- The root process prints the entire file content after all child processes complete.

## Example Output (may vary)

```plaintext
Root process: PID = 24144, creating P2 and P3
Process P2: PID = 24145, creating P4 and P5
Process P3: PID = 24146, creating P6
Process P4: PID = 24147, read line: hi
Process P6: PID = 24148, read line: hellow again
Process P5: PID = 24149, read line: hello

Root process printing lines:
hi
hello
hellow again
```

```

```
